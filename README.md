# Khayem Ben Ghorbel – Portfolio

My personal DeveloperFolio-based portfolio that highlights my background in AI, automation, web development, and cybersecurity.

## Live Site

<https://khayem487.github.io/portfolio>

## Tech Stack

- React + DeveloperFolio template
- Sass for styling
- GH Pages for hosting (`npm run deploy`)

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khayem487/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
npm install
npm start
```

## Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This builds the project and publishes the `/build` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.

Feel free to fork the repo if you want to adapt the site for yourself. Credit to the original [DeveloperFolio](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio) project for the base template.
